# go-algo
Learning go by implementing algorithms in it.


## Make
We use make for developer tasks like building and installing.

Run `make` or `make help` to see what is available.


## Running the binary
The binary is `go-algo`. 

If you use `make build` then it will be available in project root folder, so you can run it like `./go-algo`. 

If you ran `make install` it will be available in path, so you can run it from anywhere on your machine like `$> go-algo`.
